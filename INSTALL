HOTPATCH INSTALLATION
======================

Pre-requisites:

1. CMake: You need to have cmake 2.6 or above installed.
2. Compilers: gcc is needed along with standard headers.
3. GNU Make: make is needed to build the code.


How to install:

Release build:

$ make
$ make test
$ make install

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/install

If you're on a 64-bit system and want to compile for 32-bit, you can do the
following:

$ make ARCH=i386
$ make test ARCH=i386
$ make install ARCH=i386

Debug build:

$ make debug
$ make testdebug
$ make installdebug

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make installdebug PREFIX=/path/to/install

If you're on a 64-bit system and want to compile for 32-bit, you can do the
following:

$ make debug ARCH=i386
$ make testdebug ARCH=i386
$ make installdebug ARCH=i386
